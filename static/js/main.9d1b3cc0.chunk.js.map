Stepping forward and addressing the large,international crowd, the King asked for a representative of Ankara to join him. The King entered into a speach remarking on the disjointed history of the two countries since their seperation 60 years previous. King William spoke to Duke Micheal Irvine, extending an olive branch and asking whether it was time for the reunification of the country. Duke Irvine politley declined stating that a unified Bonia will never happen as long as the King styles himself as the authority of the church. Witnesses reported there was a second of movement from the King and then an explosion of blinding, white light. After several seconds, the audience regained sight and witnessed a starting sight. Where the Ankaran Duke had been, was merely a pile of ash and the King was seemingly draped in divine energy. Some audience members began to run in terror but others were shocked into silence. King William with hair reportivly draped in golden light, issued another speach. He spoke of a coming time of attonement, benediction, and unification with the Chosen. International representatives were quickly and safetly escorted from the event. Ankara has issued a formal denoucenemt of the King's action saying 'If unification was possible before, will never be now.

Crowds were perdicitably small with only a hundred or so citizens, officals, and clergy in attendance. King William spoke to the attendants saying 'A few weeks ago I spoke of the importance of faith, of conviction, of belief in the power of the Chosen. I showcased the destructive power the faithfully devote may be blessed with. Today I will give the second half of my proclomation. A few nights ago I was blessed with a revelation from Solomon, a vision of the Father's will. I saw a great city, a paradice of huminoidkind. The city was blessed by the Father and all who dwelt within it experienced peace and plenty. This is the future the Father desires, for all nations to be united in his glory for the first time since the Exodus.' At this point, King William paused his speach and kneeled down on the dirt ground. 'The Chosen have the power to destroy but this is only matched by their power to create, to bring about new beginnings!' A surge of golden energy was seen flowing from King William's hands, drapping across the ground like tree roots. The audience responded with inital fear and gradual awe as a form began to mat together from dirt and light. The figure slowly grew to a huminoid shape and finally resemble the body of a half-orc man. The light subsided as the man began to stir and rise from the ground. 'Welcome, brother Irvine.' The crowd was shocked as s realization dawned. Standing there in the same spot, where he had disappeared was a restored Duke Irvine. Not only restored, but the Duke was noticibly younger, now reduced back to his prime. Most notable change, was the Duke's eyes which now shown with brilliant light. The two figure clasps hands as the naked Irvine came to his feet. After being clothed, Duke Irvine addressed the crowd. 'When I awoke, I was in the kingdom of the Father. Brillant halls of gold and divine attendants stationed in every corner. He spoke to me, saying things I've never disclosed to anyone before. It was bliss! He asked me to return and continue his work but I didn't want to! Ha! Who would want to leave heaven? He then showed be his plan for the future, a paradise on earth as wonderful as the one I experienced in heaven! How could I say no? We have the chance to make our own future, together!' Duke Irvine exchanged a heavy hug with his supposed murded before King William resumed. 'This work will be hard and take the contribution of everyone from farmer to noble. To this end I will be issuing an edict demanding a renewed tribute of gold and raw materials to fund construction of this great work.' The King concluded the event with a worship ceremony to the Father and Chosen.
